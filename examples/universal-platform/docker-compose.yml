# Desktop tier — actually runs the 6 resources described in the CUE model.
#
# Container names match the CUE-compiled commands exactly:
#   platform-dns, platform-proxy, platform-db, platform-app, platform-mon
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose up -d       # start all services
#   make demo                  # build JSON + start API server
#   # Then use the UI to execute commands against real containers
