# ADR-007: CUE conditional branches for optional charter scope fields

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | accepted |
| Date | 2026-02-18 |

## Context

Charter #GapAnalysis used count_satisfied: true as a default — in CUE, this is a hard constraint, not a default.

## Decision

Use mutually exclusive conditional branches with a bool type constraint instead of a hard true default.

## Rationale

CUE unification makes foo: true into an immutable constraint. The only way to conditionally set a field is via mutually exclusive if branches.

## Consequences

- depth_satisfied and count_satisfied now use bool type + conditional branches
- Charter gap analysis works correctly when graph has fewer resources than scope requires
- cue vet on public fields catches conflicts that hidden-field tests miss
