# ADR-008: Domain-general framing: 'things that depend on other things'

## Context

Public surfaces framed quicue.ca as 'infrastructure as typed dependency graphs.' This undersells the framework.

## Decision

Frame as 'CUE framework for modeling any domain where things depend on other things.' The entry point is two fields: @type and depends_on.

## Rationale

The core requirement is: typed nodes with directed dependency edges. That's domain-independent.

## Consequences

- GitHub profile, repo descriptions, and docs all use domain-general language
- Downstream table replaces domain-specific prose as the credibility signal
- 'Infrastructure' appears only when describing the IT domain specifically
