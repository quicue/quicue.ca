# ADR-014: ASCII-safe identifiers (#SafeID, #SafeLabel) on all graph surfaces

## Context

CUE unification treats string values as opaque byte sequences. Cyrillic 'a' and Latin 'a' are different CUE values that look identical.

## Decision

Constrain all graph identifiers to ASCII via regex. #SafeID for resource names, #SafeLabel for type keys.

## Rationale

Constraining identifiers to ASCII eliminates the entire class of unicode-based confusion attacks.

## Consequences

- All resource names, @type keys, depends_on keys must be ASCII
- patterns/graph.cue defines hidden mirrors (_#SafeID, _#SafeLabel)
- boot/resource.cue uses inline regex (no cross-package hidden field access)
- Downstream repos inherit constraints via quicue.ca symlink
- apercue.ca has identical constraints — both layers enforce independently
