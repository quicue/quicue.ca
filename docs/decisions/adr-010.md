# ADR-010: Game design projects tracked separately from quicue.ca

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Status | accepted |
| Date | 2026-02-18 |

## Context

mud-futurama and fing-mod use quicue.ca/kg but listing them as downstream dilutes the message.

## Decision

Remove game design projects from quicue.ca's downstream registry and all public documentation.

## Rationale

Including game projects alongside CMHC retrofit and production datacenter management undermines credibility.

## Consequences

- mud-futurama and fing-mod removed from .kb/downstream.cue
- Downstream count: 4 projects across 4 domains
- Game projects maintain their own .kb/ independently
- No game/MUD references on any quicue.ca public surface
