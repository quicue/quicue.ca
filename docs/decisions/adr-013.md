# ADR-013: Lifecycle management in patterns/, not a separate orche/ package

## Context

boot/ and orche/ reference packages that don't exist. patterns/ already has lifecycle-adjacent definitions.

## Decision

Absorb lifecycle management into patterns/lifecycle.cue. No separate orche/ package.

## Rationale

CUE's strength is type composition via unification. Types that compose belong together.

## Consequences

- patterns/lifecycle.cue created with #BootstrapPlan, #DriftReport, #SmokeTest, #DeploymentLifecycle
- boot/ types refactored into patterns/
- examples/drift-detection/ updated to import patterns/ instead of orche/
- No orche/ module to publish or version separately
