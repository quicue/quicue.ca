# ADR-006: Public showcase data sourced exclusively from example datacenter

## Context

Public surfaces were originally built from production infrastructure data containing real 172.20.x.x IPs.

## Decision

All public-facing data is generated from examples/datacenter/ which uses RFC 5737 TEST-NET IPs (198.51.100.x). CI validates no real IPs leak.

## Rationale

A single source of safe data eliminates the risk of production IP leakage.

## Consequences

- All public surfaces serve data from examples/datacenter/ only
- CI validates no 172.x.x.x IPs in generated files
- Deploy scripts are parameterized — no hardcoded infrastructure hostnames
- Production data stays behind CF Access on apercue.ca surfaces
