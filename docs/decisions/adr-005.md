# ADR-005: Charter: constraint schema with computed gap analysis

## Context

Downstream projects each have verify.cue files with identical patterns. The pattern is ad-hoc — no shared vocabulary, no intermediate checkpoints.

## Decision

Charter defines #Charter (scope + gates), #Gate (DAG checkpoint), #GapAnalysis (computed missing resources, types, gate status), and #Milestone (single gate evaluation).

## Rationale

Raw cue vet errors are unstructured text. #GapAnalysis produces typed CUE output consumable programmatically.

## Consequences

- Downstream projects use #GapAnalysis to compute structured backlog from charter + graph
- Gate DAG subsumes linear phases — a chain is a degenerate DAG
- #Milestone provides focused per-gate evaluation without full gap analysis
- Gap analysis output is typed and exportable as JSON
