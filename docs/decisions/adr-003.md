# ADR-003: Compile-time provider binding: all parameters resolve at cue eval

## Context

Provider templates define commands with parameters ({host}, {container_id}). These could be resolved at runtime or at CUE evaluation time.

## Decision

#BindCluster matches providers to resources by @type overlap, then #ResolveTemplate substitutes all {param} placeholders from resource fields at cue eval time.

## Rationale

Compile-time resolution means CUE catches missing fields before anything runs. A missing container_id is a type error, not a runtime 'undefined variable'.

## Consequences

- Resources must declare all fields their bound providers reference
- Provider templates use {param} syntax with explicit from_field bindings
- The output of cue export is fully resolved — ready to execute
- No runtime templating engine needed
