# ADR-011: lacuene is not a downstream consumer

## Context

lacuene was listed as a downstream project but does not import quicue.ca/patterns or quicue.ca/vocab.

## Decision

Remove lacuene from all downstream claims. Only projects that import quicue.ca are listed.

## Rationale

Listing a project that doesn't use the framework as a consumer is inaccurate.

## Consequences

- lacuene removed from README, docs, and all docs
- Downstream criteria: must import quicue.ca/patterns or quicue.ca/vocab
- 'Biomedical research' removed from domain list
