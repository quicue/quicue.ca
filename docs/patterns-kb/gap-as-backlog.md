# Gap-as-Backlog

**Category:** planning

## Problem

Project planning tools track work items separately from the system. The backlog drifts.

## Solution

Declare 'done' as CUE constraints on an incomplete graph. The gap IS the remaining work.

## Context

Any project built incrementally where completion criteria can be expressed as graph properties.
